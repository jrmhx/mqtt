# COMP3310 A3 MQTT Project

*Jeremiah Xing (u7439274)*

## Requirements

- Java JDK 21 or higher
- Gradle 8.6 or higher

**_NOTE:_** If you already installed the correct version of Gradle. Run `gradle build` might automatically download the required JDK if it is missing. However, if it doesn't work, you can download and install the JDK manually.

If you open this project via IDEs like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), it will prompt you to download the JDK if it is missing. General guides of how to install Gradle and JDK are also provided below:

- How to install Gradle: [Gradle Installation Guide](https://gradle.org/install/)
- How to install JDK: [OpenJDK JDK 21.0.2 General-Availability Release](https://jdk.java.net/21/)

### **_NOTE:_** An Easy Take-Off for Marking Tutors:

If you are the tutor who is marking this assignment and want to save some time, after config the required environment below, under the project root directory, you can simply:

```bash
gradle build
gradle run
```

Then you can see the output in the console.

If you want to save the output to a file, you can run:

```bash
gradle build
gradle run > output.log
cat output.log
```

The output will be saved in the `output.log` file.

## Build

Under the project root directory, run the following commands to build the application via Gradle:

```bash
gradle build
```

## Run

After building the application, you can simply run the application using the following command:

```bash
gradle run
```

This will connect to the default Gopher server `comp3310.ddns.net:70` with default indexing depth `1024`, and index the files on it. The application will then print the indexed files and statistics to the console.

You can also save the output to a file by running the following command:

```bash
gradle run > output.log
```

You can check the output in the `output.log` file with better rendering in console via:

```bash
cat output.log
```


## Usage

The application is a command-line tool that accepts the following arguments:

```bash
gradle run [-PappArgs="['<hostname>', '<port number>', '<depth limit>']"]
```

- `<hostname>`: the hostname of the Gopher server to connect to
- `<port number>`: the port number of the Gopher server to connect to
- `<depth limit>`: the maximum depth to index directories on the server (default is `1024`)
- If no arguments are provided, the application will connect to the default Gopher server `comp3310.ddns.net` on port `70` with `1024` max indexing depth.

Example of running the application with arguments:

```bash
gradle run -PappArgs="['comp3310.ddns.net', '70', '5']"
```
This will connect to the Gopher server `comp3310.ddns.net` on port `70` with a maximum indexing depth of `5`.



## Implementation

- The application is implemented in Java using `Socket()` API in the `java.net` package for network operations.
- The application only handle 4 kinds of Gopher items as required in the assignment: text files (type 0), directories (type 1), binary files (type 9), and error messages (type 3). Other types of items are ignored.
- The `ConnectionHandler` class is used to manage the socket connection.
    - It has applied a timeout for each connection and response-read.
    - 2 retries are allowed if the connection fails. Exponential backoff is used to increase the waiting time between retries.
    - The size of the response are also limited to 1MB in case of edge case large response.
- The `GopherIndexer` class is the main class that manages the connection to the Gopher server, fetches and indexes files, and logs statistics.
- The `Logger` class is used to customize logging messages and statistics. It uses ANSI escape codes to colorize the output for better readability. There are 3 types of log levels: `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `SEVERE`.
    - `INFO`: normal information messages, ANSI color code: green
    - `WARNING`: warning messages, ANSI color code: yellow
    - `SEVERE`: severe error messages, ANSI color code: red
- The successfully fetched files can be found in the `download_files` directory under the project root directory after running the application. The file name might be changed for a safe file-save operation.

## Edge Cases Handling

- The application handles the edge case where the server response is empty or null.
- The application handles the edge case where the server response is too large to be read.
- The application handles the edge case where the server response is not a valid Gopher item.
- The application handles the edge case where the server response is a type 3 error message.
- The application handles the edge case where the server has duplicate directories.
- The application handles the edge case where the server has a circular reference to itself.
- The application handles the edge case where the server has a very deep directory structure. (you can manually set depth limit).

## Output

- The application will output the log while it indexing;
- The statistics will be printed at the end of the indexing process. The statistics include:
    - Total Directories on the Server:
        - Displays the count of directories identified on the server, including the root directory. Some directories may be unreachably stored on the server, not all directories are fetched, and the count includes those marked with a data type '1' and a vaild data format accordingly, which represents directories on the server and the server root directories itself.
    - List of Directories:
        - If there are any directories found, a list of all directory paths on the server is printed.
    - Total Text Files:
        - The number of text files successfully fetched from the server is displayed.
    - List of Text Files:
        - If text files are found, their paths are listed.
    - Total Bad Text Files:
        - Indicates the number of text files that were fetched unsuccessfully.
    - List of Bad Text Files:
        - Lists the paths of text files that were fetched unsuccessfully.
    - Total Binary Files:
        - Displays the count of binary files that were successfully fetched.
    - List of Binary Files:
        - Lists the paths of successfully fetched binary files.
    - Total Bad Binary Files:
        - Indicates the number of binary files that were fetched but were either empty or received a null response.
    - List of Bad Binary Files:
        - Lists the paths of binary files that were empty or had a null response.
    - File Size Statistics:
        - Reports the content of the smallest text file,
        - the size of the largest text file in bytes,
        - the size of the smallest binary file in bytes,
        - and the size of the largest binary file in bytes.
    - External Servers:
        - Counts and lists external servers that are up and those that are down.
    - Unique Invalid References:
        - Displays the number of unique invalid references encountered (type 3) and lists them.
    - Error Statistics:
        - Displays the number of errors encountered during the indexing process.

## Documentation

The source code is documented using Javadoc comments. You can generate the Javadoc documentation by running the following command:

```bash
gradle javadoc
```

The generated documentation can be found in the `build/docs/javadoc` directory. You can open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the documentation.


```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.jrmh.Publisher"
```
